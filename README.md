# Human_Activity_Recognition
The preprocessed and normalised data was used to build machine learning models that predicted the user's activity at a given time point.
Exploratory data analysis was performed utilising several models such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE, and the data was trained on certain time series models such as ARMA, ARIMA, alongwith traditional ML models like KNN, SVM, Decision Trees etc.
